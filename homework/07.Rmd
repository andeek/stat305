1. [Ch. 5.1, Exercise 6, pg. 244] Suppose that an eddy current nondestructive evaluation technique for identifying cracks in critical metal parts has a probability of abound $.20$ of detecting a single crack of length $.003$in. in a certain material. Let $Y$ be the number of specimens inspected in order to obtain the first crack detection. Use an appropriate probability model and evaluate all of the following:
    a) $P[Y = 5]$
    b) $P[Y \le 4]$
    c) $\text{E}Y$
    d) $\text{Var}Y$
    e) $\text{SD}(Y)$
    
2. [Ch. 5.1, Exercise 9, pg. 244] Transmission line interruptions in a telecommunication network occur at an average rate of one per day.
    a) Use a Poisson distribution as a model for
        $$
        X = \text{the number of interruptions in the next five-day work week}
        $$
        
        and assess $P[X = 0]$
    b) Now consider the random variable
        $$
        Y = \text{the number of weeks in the next four in which there are no interruptions}
        $$
        What is a reasonable probability model for $Y$? Assess $P[Y = 2]$.

3. [Ch. 5.2, Exercise 1, pg. 263] The random number generator supplied on a calculator is not terribly well chosen, in that values it generates are not adequately described by a uniform distribution on the interval $(0,1)$. Suppose instead that a probability density
    $$
    f(x) = \begin{cases} k(5 - x) & 0 < x< 1 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}
    $$
    
    is a more appropriate model for $X =$ the next value produced by this random number generator.
    
    a) Find the value of $k$
    b) Sketch the probability density involved here.
    c) Evaluate $P[.25 < X < .75]$
    d) Compute and graph the cumulative probability distribution function for $X$, $F(x)$.
    e) Calculate $\text{E}X$ and the standard deviation of $X$.
    
4. The mileage to first failure for a model of military personnel carrier can be modeled as exponential with mean $1,000$ miles.
    a) Evaluate the probability that a vehicle of this type gives less than $500$ miles of service before first failure. Evaluate the probability that a vehicle of this type gives less than $2000$ miles of service before first failure. 
    b) Find the $.05$ quantile of the distribution of mileage to first failure. Then find the $.9$ quantile of the distribution.
