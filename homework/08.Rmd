1. [Ch. 5.2, Exercise 2, pg. 263] Suppose that $Z$ is a standard normal random variable. Evaluate the following probabilities involving $Z$:
    a) $P[Z < -.62]$
    a) $P[Z > 1.06]$
    a) $P[-.37 < Z < .51]$
    a) $P[|Z| \le .47]$
    a) $P[|Z| > .93]$
    a) $P[-3.0 < Z < 3.0]$
    
    Now find numbers # such that the following statements involving $Z$ are true:
    
    g) $P[Z \le \#] = .90$
    g) $P[|Z| \le \#] = .90$
    g) $P[|Z| > \#] = .03$
    
2. [Ch. 5.2, Exercise 3, pg. 263] Suppose that $X$ is a normal random variable with mean $43$ and standard deviation $3.6$. Evaluate the following probabilities involving $X$:
    a) $P[X < 45.2]$
    a) $P[X \le 41.7]$
    a) $P[43.8 < X \le 47.0]$
    a) $P[|X - 43| \le 2]$
    a) $P[|X - 43| > 1.7]$
    
    Now find numbers # such that the following statements involving $X$ are true:
    
    f) $P[X < \#] = .95$
    g) $P[X \ge \#] = .30$
    h) $P[|X - 43| > \#] = .05$
