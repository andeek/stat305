# Introduction

First we start with a roadmap for the course. The subject of **engineering statistics** is defined, its importance is described and basic terminology is introduced.

## What is statistics?

Statistics is the science of collecting, presenting, analyzing, and making decisions from data. Often, as an engineer, it is necessary to **collect and interpret data** that will help in understanding how a new system or product works. 

Statistics has applications to engineering through quality control, process control, reliability, risk management, system identification, design of experiments, etc.

\begin{df}
\emph{Engineering statistics} is the study of how best to 
\begin{enumerate}
\item collect engineering data,
\item summarize or describe engineering data, and
\item draw formal inference and practical conclusions on the basis of engineering data,
\end{enumerate}
all while recognizing the reality of variation.
\end{df}

We can break down this study into three main tasks:

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Summary:} 
\item {\bf Inference:}
\item {\bf Interpretation:}
\end{enumerate}
