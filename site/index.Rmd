You can find [on-campus computers equipped with JMP](https://www.it.iastate.edu/labsdb/?q=JMP).   
  
  
You can also use R, freely available for [download](https://cloud.r-project.org/).

# Grading

You can check your grades on [Blackboard](https://bb.its.iastate.edu/webapps/portal/frameset.jsp).

Your final grade is a weighted average of 

- homework (25%), 
- exam 1 (25%), 
- exam 2 (25%), and 
- final exam (25%). 

Your lowest homework grade will be dropped before making the calculation. 

I will assign letter grades as follows:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
grades <- data.frame("Letter grade" = c("A", "A-", "B+", "B", "B-", "C+", "C", "C-", "D+", "D", "D-", "F"),
                     "Percentage grade X" = c("X ≥ 93%", "89% ≤ X < 93%", 
                                              "86% ≤ X < 89%", "83% ≤ X < 86%", "79% ≤ X < 83%",
                                              "76% ≤ X < 79%", "73% ≤ X < 76%", "69% ≤ X < 73%",
                                              "66% ≤ X < 69%", "63% ≤ X < 66%", "59% ≤ X < 63%",
                                              "X < 59%"))

knitr::kable(grades, col.names = c("Letter grade", "Percentage grade X"))
```

# Homework

Rules for completing homework assignments:

 - Show your work. Without work, no partial credit is possible.
 - You are encouraged to work on homework with your peers. However, your problem sets must be written by you and only you, in your own words, and only with the calculations that you yourself did.
 
Weekly homework assignments, along with their respective due dates, are be posted at <http://andeekaplan.com/stat305/materials.html>. Homeworks will be due on **Mondays in class**, unless otherwise notified in class and/or on the website. Submission must be in hard copy form (printed + stapled) except under extenuating circumstances. 

**No late homework will be accepted**. At the end of the semester, your lowest assignment grade will be dropped. If you are unable to attend class on the day the homework is due it is your responsibility to turn it in *before* the due date. Please note, there will be a homework assignment due during *dead week*.

# Exams

Rules for exams:

- All the usual exam ethics apply. Please ask the instructor if you have questions.
- You may bring *only* the following materials to the exams:
    - A writing utensil.
    - An approved hand-held calculator. You will not need anything more powerful than a 4-function calculator, but you may bring anything as powerful as a graphing calculator such as a TI-83 or TI-89. You may not use a device with networking capabilities (cell phone, tablet, computer). Please contact me if you are not sure if your calculator qualifies.
    - An 8.5" × 11" sheet of paper of your own notes to help you during the exam. You may use both sides of the page, and you may write anything you want except for solutions to example problems and exam notes copied from another student.
- During an exam, you will be provided with:
    - Enough scratch paper.
    - Enough computer output to complete the exam.
    - All necessary probability tables, which may include standard normal tables, Student t tables, chisquare tables, or F tables.

Exam information:

Exams will be held on the evening (6 - 8pm) of the follwing dates. On exam days there will be no in-class lecture. If you have a conflict, please notify the instructor at least **one week in advance** to reschedule.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
exams <- data.frame(Exam = c("Exam 1", "Exam 2", "Final Exam**"),
                    Date = c("June 5", "June 26", "July 7"),
                    Location = c("Gilman 2272", "Carver 0274", "Carver 0274"),
                    Topics = c("Ch. 1-4", "Ch. 5", "Ch. 1-6, 9"))

knitr::kable(exams)
```

**The Final Exam is comprehensive. Final Exams cannot be taken early!

# Conduct and Attendance

Please bring your calculators to class because I will often have you do in-class exercises. Also, please bring any probability tables (standard normal table, Student t table, etc.) to class after I have taught you how to use them. 

All the usual rules of classroom etiquette apply. Please be respectful to your peers and your instructor. We need a quiet, distraction-free environment.

I will not take formal attendance in the class, but attendance in class strongly recommended. You are responsible for all material presented in lecture and/or assigned as required reading.  If an unexpected illness or incident occurs due to which you are unable to complete the necessary tasks, it is your responsibility to review the notes from class with a friend before contacting the instructor and getting help in office hours.

# Advice

In order to have a successful semester in this class, it is in your best interest to attend all lecture and follow along with the notes in class. Please come to class, it will make exam preparation and homework easier. Reading the textbook material will be helpful to fill in any gaps in your understanding. 

If you keep up with lecture and reading, it is my hope that you will be able to solve most homework problems within an hour each. If you are stumped for over an hour, please e-mail me or come to office hours. Ask for help along the way and the class will go much smoother for both of us.
